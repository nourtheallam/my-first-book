# Self-Adjusting Lists

### 1. Problem: linear search

Given $n$ elements, and a key for an element, search for it by linearly iterating through the list. 

Worst case: $n$ comparisons 

Average case: If all elements have equal probability of search, then the expected time is $\frac{n+1}{2}$ in successful case and $n$ for an unsuccessful. 

- How did we get $\frac{n+1}{2}$?
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{1}{n}\cdot 1 + \frac{1}{n} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{n} \cdot 3 + \dots + \frac{1}{n} \cdot n \\= \frac{1}{n}(1+2+ \dots + n) \\= \frac{n+1}{2} \end{aligned}$$

### 2. Real Questions 

#### 1. What if the probabilities of access differ?

Let $p_{i}$ be the probability of requesting element $i$. 

#### 2. What if these (independent) probabilities are not given?

#### 3. How do solutions compare with the best we could do


### 3. Self-adjusting data structures - Adapt to changing probabilities

#### 1. If probabilities are the same and independent, it doesn't matter how you change the structure 

#### 2. If both probabilities and list are fixed, minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n i p_{i}$

Greedy: element with the highest probability should be placed first.

Let $S_{opt}$ be the starting optimal solution.
#### 3. How can we adapt to changes in probability or self-adjust?

Move elements forward as accessed. 

Heuristics: 
- Move-to-front (MTF): after an item is accessed, move it to the front of the list. 
- Transpose (TR): After an item is accessed, exchange it with the immediate preceding item. 
- Frequency count (FC): Maintain a frequency count for each item, initially $0$. Increase the count of an item by $1$ whenever it is accessed. Maintain a list such that the items are in decreasing order by frequency count. 

### 4. Static optimality 

#### 1. Compare MTF to $S_{opt}$

### 2. Model 

Start with an empty list.
Scan for elements requested. If not present
    Insert (and change) as if found at the end of the list (then apply heuristic)

Cost: number of comparisons 
#### 3. The cost of MTF $\leq 2\cdot S_{opt}$ for any sequence of requests

**Proof**

Consider an arbitrary list, but focus on searches for $b$, $c$ (two arbitrary elements), and "unsuccessful comparisons" where we compare query value $b$ against $c$ or $c$ against $b$. 

Assume the request sequence has $k$ $b$'s and $m$ $c$'s (no assumption on order of searches). Without loss of generality, assume that $k \leq m$. 

$S_{opt}$ order is $c b$ and there are $k$ unsuccessful comparisons. 

What order of requests maximizes this number under MTF?

Clearly, $C^{m-k}(bc)^k$.

There are $2k$ unsuccessful comparisons. 

Under MTF, an unsuccessful comparison will happen whenever the request sequence changes, from $b$ to $c$ or $c$ to $b$. 

Since each change involves a $b$ and each $b$ can be involved in at most two changes, the total number of such changes is $\leq 2k$. 

This holds for any pair of elements, sum over all the total number of unsuccessful comparisons of MTF
$$\leq 2 \cdot \dots \cdot S_{opt}$$
- [ ] ðŸ”¼ What is this?

We also observe that the total number of successful comparisons of MTF and the total number of successful comparisons of $S_{opt}$ are equal. 

And the number of cost of MTF is at most $2 \cdot S_{opt}$. 

#### 4. This bound is tight. 

Given $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \dots , a_{n}$, we repeatedly ask for the last element in the list. So, the elements are requested equally often. 

The cost of MTF is $n$ comparisons per search. But for the $S_{opt}$, every item has the same probability of being accessed, so the cost is $\frac{n+1}{2}$. 

#### 5. For some sequences, MTF does much better 

Consider the following sequence of requests
$$a_{1}^n \ a_{2}^n \dots a_{n}^n$$
The cost of $S_{opt}$ would be $\frac{n+1}{2}$ 

The cost of MTF would be 
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{(1+(n-1)) + (2+(n-1)) + (3+(n-1)) + \dots + (n + (n-1))}{n^2}\\ = \frac{\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n(n-1)}{n^2} \\ = \frac{3}{2} - \Theta\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \end{aligned}$$
  
### 5. Dynamic optimality

#### 1. Online vs Offline 

- Online: Must respond as requests come
- Offline: Get to see the entire schedule and determine how to move values 

#### 2. Competitive ratio of $Alg$

$=$ worst case of $\frac{\text{Online time of }Alg}{\text{Optimal offline time}}$

#### 3. A method is "competitive" if this ratio is a constant

#### 4. Model 

- Search for or change element in position $i$: scan to location $i$ at cost $i$
- Free exchange: exchanges (swaps) between adjacent elements that are required to move element $i$ closer to the front are free of cost
- Paid exchange: any other exchange (swapping) between adjacent elements costs $1$

**Before cost of self-adjusting**
- $Access$: costs $i$ if element is in position $i$
- $Delete$: costs $i$ if element is in position $i$
- $Insert$: costs $n+1$ if $n$ elements are already there 

#### 5. Definitions

- Request sequence: $M$ queries, $n$ max data values
- Start with empty list 
- Cost model for a search that ends with finding the element at position $i$ is $i +$ number of paid exchanges
- $C_{A}(S)$: the total cost of all operations for an algorithm $A$, not counting paid exchanges 
- $X_{A}(S)$: number of paid exchanges 
$$X_{MTF}(S) = X_{TR}(S) = X_{FC}(S) = 0$$
- $F_{A}(S)$: number of free exchanges

**Observation:** $F_{A}(S) \leq C_{A}(S) - M$
After accessing the $i$th element,  there are $\leq i - 1$ free exchanges. 

**Claim:** $C_{MTF} \leq 2 C_{A}(S) + X_{A}(S) - F_{A}(S) - M$ for any algorithm $A$ starting with an empty set

**Proof:** 

We run $A$ and $MTF$ in parallel, on the same request sequence $S$. The potential function $\phi$ is defined as the number of inversions* between $MTF$'s list and $A$'s list. Now, we bound the time of $access$. 

Consider access by $A$ to position $i$ and assume we go to position $k$ is $MTF$'s list. Let $x_{i}$ be the number of items preceding the element in $MTF$'s list but not $A$'s list. So, the number of items preceding it in both lists is $k-1 - x_{i}$.

Moving the element to front in $MTF$'s list creates $k - 1 - x_{i}$ (between the element and those that used to precede it), and destroys $x_{i}$ inversions. 


Amortized analysis: 
$$k + (k-1-x_{i}) - x_{i} = 2(k-x_{i}) - 1$$
Since $k-1-x_{i} \leq i-1$, we can conclude that $k-x_{i} \leq i$. 

This gives us an amortized time of $\leq 2i - 1 = 2C_{A} - 1$ where $C_{A}$ is the cost of access for $A$ without exchanges (similar to insert/delete). An exchange by $A$ has $0$ cost to $MTF$, so the amortized time of an exchange by $A$ is increased in the number of inversions caused by exchange: $1$ for paid, $-1$ for free. 
- [ ] #skipped for now ...
So, the total amortized cost is 
$$2C_{A}(S) - M + X_{A}(S) - F_{A}(S)$$

**Conclusion**

MTF is $2$-competitive 

$$\begin{aligned} T_{A}(S) &= C_{A}(S) + X_{A}(S) \\ T_{MTF}(S) &= C_{MTF}(S) \\ &\leq 2C_{A}(S) + X_{A}(S) - F_{A}(S) - M \\ &\leq 2T_{A}(S) \end{aligned}$$
\* An inversion is defined as any pair of elements that appear in different orders relative to each other in different lists.
